      <p>Hey, my name is Kayla, and I am a UX Researcher. <br><br>I graduated from Florida International University with a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology. In the homestretch of my degree I hit the ground running conducting research in Gozo, Malta surrounding the motives and experiences of African migrants there. As a multi-ethnic woman of color, growing up, I became increasingly interested in niche communities, cultures different from my own, and the impact of having to navigate one’s own cultural identity. <br><br> Post-graduate, I was struggling to figure out what to do with my life and coveted degree.  About a year into my career-search a mentor blessed me by posting an article that introduced me to User Experience Research and Design, explaining how UX and Anthropology go hand-in-hand. I fell in love instantly and the rest is history- I’ve been committed to sharpening my UX Design and Research skills ever since.
<br><br>I focus primarily on Research (this includes ethnography, interviewing, field observation, and data analysis among other things), but I work everyday to partake in every aspect of the UX Design process. I do this so no matter what part of a project I am involved in I can understand and collaborate effectively with my colleagues. So you can catch me doing user testing, prototyping, hi-fidelity mockup-ing, and everything in between (:
<br><br>It is truly my belief that User Experience done properly can make great strides in improving the experiences of underserved and underrepresented communities and peoples, as well as address current, critical, social events. I am passionate about the realm of UX because I want to help people that are most in need.
<br><br>When I’m not reading UX Research studies or fiddling with Adobe Creative Cloud, I enjoy being an at-home movie critic, amateur weightlifter, and a novice photographer.
